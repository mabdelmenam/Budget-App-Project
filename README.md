# Budget-App-Project

**Done using HTML, CSS, JavaScript ES5**


Application allows user to add income and expenses for a certain month and calculates how much money was made and spent in that month.

**This application was done in during my, "The Complete JavaScript Course: 2018", by Jonas Schmedtmann**

*Application displays overall income and expense.

*Gives the user the option to delete an item from the list in case an error was made.


***HTML and CSS were not done by me,but I ofcourse took the time to try and understand them in order to use them in the JavaScript code***
